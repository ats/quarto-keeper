# quarto-keeper

Like a Trapper Keeper, but in Quarto, and for making notes at big meetings or conferences. The visual editor in RStudio is a great environment to make conference notes because it handles dragging and dropping screenshots well, and if you want to ride along with code demos you're already in an environment where all you have to do is drop in code chunks.

## Usage

Quarto-keeper provides a high-level starting structure with several default files to capture different kinds of notes in. Add or uncomment document lines in the `_quarto.yml` file to include additional files in your compiled notebook. Starting files include pages to capture

 - keynotes
 - sessions or meetings
 - snippets of code and other key takeaways
 - reflections: things to come back to, think about, etc.
 
Capture what you want during the meeting or conference, and when you're ready you can render the book to a nice output doc for easy use or sharing. That's what it says on the tin.
