# Quarto-Keeper

Like a Trapper Keeper, but in [Quarto](https://quarto.org), and for making notes at big meetings or conferences. The visual editor in RStudio is a great environment to make conference notes because it handles dragging and dropping screenshots well, and if you want to ride along with code demos you're already in an environment where all you have to do is drop in code chunks.

## Usage

In `_quarto.yml`, rename the title to whatever event you're attending, and then adjust the "chapters" as needed: 

Quarto-Keeper provides a high-level starting structure with several default files to capture different kinds of notes in. Add or uncomment document lines in `_quarto.yml` to include additional files in your compiled notebook. Starting files include pages to capture

 - keynotes
 - sessions or meetings
 - snippets of code and other key takeaways
 - reflections: things to come back to, think about, etc.
 
There are a couple-few notes in some of these template files to get you started. 
 
Capture what you want during the meeting or conference, and whenever you're ready you can render the book to a nice output doc for easy use or sharing. If you preview the HTML outpu or publish it to a web server, the embedded javascript search will work, too. You've made yourself a nice little portable, shareable notebook of your conf or meeting experience!
